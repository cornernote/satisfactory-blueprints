Blueprints are done in Update 8. 
Older Satisfactory versions will crush upon blueprint use.

Place blueprints into the following path:

C:\Users\YOURUSERNAME\AppData\Local\FactoryGame\Saved\SaveGames\blueprints\SESSIONNAME

If there is no session folder inside blueprints\ folder you need to unlock blueprints in the game session progression first, then save any blueprint inside of the game. Session folder for blueprints would be created.
